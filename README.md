📊 Key Insights (with Tools & Methodology)

🎓 Education Impacts Response Rates
Insight: Customers with higher education levels (Master’s, PhD) showed stronger response rates.

Tools Used:
SQL: Grouped customers by education level and calculated response rates.
Python (Seaborn): Visualized response percentages clearly across categories.

Takeaway: Educational segmentation can improve targeting precision in future campaigns.

💰 Middle-to-High Income Customers Respond More
Insight: Customers earning in the mid-to-high income brackets engaged more with the campaign.

Tools Used:
SQL: Binned income into brackets and calculated total responses per group.
Python (Matplotlib): Displayed a clean bar chart comparing income brackets and response rates.

Takeaway: Income-based personalization could drive higher ROI.

🍷 Wine Spending is Linked to Campaign Engagement
Insight: Responders, on average, spend significantly more on wine products.

Tools Used:
SQL: Aggregated average wine spending by response status.
Python (Bar plot): Visualized spending patterns across responders and non-responders.

Takeaway: High spenders may also be brand-loyal — ideal for retargeting.

🛍️ Digital Shopping Habits Influence Response
Insight: Customers who make more web purchases are more likely to respond to campaigns.

Tools Used:
SQL: Averaged web purchase frequency by response.
Python: Visualized subtle but meaningful differences between responders.

Takeaway: Web-savvy customers are more responsive — optimize digital-first strategies.

🧠 Customer Behavior Segmentation Unlocks Deeper Patterns
Insight: By combining income, education, wine spending, and web purchases, distinct responder profiles emerge.

Tools Used:
SQL: Filtered high-spending, high-response segments by multiple criteria.
Python (Scatter & Dual-axis bar plots): Explored interactions across variables.

Takeaway: Multi-variable segmentation is key to identifying high-value targets.

🧮 Education + Income = Most Powerful Predictor Combo
Insight: When education and income are cross-tabulated, a clear profile of the ideal customer emerges.

Tools Used:
SQL: Grouped and aggregated data by both education and income group.
Python (Clustered bar chart): Displayed response rates across combined segments.

Takeaway: Use both demographic and financial data to create smarter, data-driven campaigns.
